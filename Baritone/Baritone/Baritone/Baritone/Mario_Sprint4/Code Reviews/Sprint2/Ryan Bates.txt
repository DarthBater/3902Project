Sprint: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: SpriteBlock.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Evan Harrell
Specific comments on code quality:

Follows general outline we have for most of our sprites. It is on par with our other sprite .cs files. Has the ability to hold an item, which
is held in the item global variable. A lot of the checks are done manually since we don't have a state machine at the moment. This is a common
theme for all of our sprite files. Example of this in the OnCollision method we check to make sure the block is not already broken.


Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

Group has expressed interest in creating the state machine, in which case there will be some code in this file that will be made redundant. 
We would have to do some rewriting here, and almost all of our other sprite files, if we do decide to go down this path. However, it has the 
potential to make the game much easier to read and easier to add future content.
