Sprint: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: SpriteMario.cs (Namely, the Sprint2 additions)
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Ryan Bates / Nick Chehade

Specific comments on code quality:

I'm primarily looking at how collision were implemented. That said, the first thing I noticed was that an Injure
method was added which handles the various state changes when Mario interacts with an enemy.
The function creates a timer for Star and Fire, and adjusts sheet and sprite states accordingly.
More on this in the changes section

The second thing I looked for was how collisions with other various objects were handled. They weren't handled
in SpriteMario, which is actually a good thing. Collisions were handled in the appropriate classes, such as
SpriteGoomba or SpriteFloor.

I'm curious as to why the star state is being tracked in OnCollision. This will likely be changed when our
State Machine is added, but even without the SM, this makes no sense as to why it is tracked in OnCollision.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

So this was determined before code reviews, but these implementations will likely all change when we get around
to implementing a State Machine for both movement states and powerup states. These changes will take place
sometime in the near future considering the vast majority of Sprint 3 is already done.
