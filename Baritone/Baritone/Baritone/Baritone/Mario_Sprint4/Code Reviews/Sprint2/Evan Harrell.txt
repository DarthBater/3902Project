Specific comments on code quality:

This file is our factory design pattern for our sprites.  It contains a method for loading the textures from our sprite content folders.  It also contains
the methods that create (by calling the constructor) and returning the sprite for the game.  These methods are called by our LevelLoader which parses a 
text file to create the sprites needed for our game.  A few of these methods differ in various ways.  The koopa method takes a parameter for color (red or
green).  Similarly, there are two mushroom methods that call the constructor for a mushroom using a different sprite path as both 1UP and Super mushrooms
use the same sprite methods, but just different sprite textures.  Blocks have two methods each, one for an itemless block and one for an item.  The parser
takes an item argument as an option, and if it is specified calls the block item method which creates a block and an item "in" the block.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

We will need to modify the block code most likely to allow for multiple coins, and we may even want to determine block items on collision time rather
than load time.  We will also need to get rid of the methods for creating hidden and question blocks without items since those blocks are not needed
for the game as a whole.
