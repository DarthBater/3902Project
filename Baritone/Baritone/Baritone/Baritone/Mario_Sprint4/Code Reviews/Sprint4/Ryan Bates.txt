Sprint: 4
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: HuDLayer.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Matt Weiss
Specific comments on code quality:

Uses SpriteLayer interface to effectively remove code from Sprint3, which really cleans it up. Works well with SpriteLayer in
that you can easily add and remove sprites from the hud. I think the game inputs could potentially be placed somewhere else
which would keep the HuDLayer class strictly involve the HuD.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

If we were to add different fonts for the HuD or add custom fonts to mimic super mario a little better, you would have to change a few lines
of code but the actual class would not fail.
