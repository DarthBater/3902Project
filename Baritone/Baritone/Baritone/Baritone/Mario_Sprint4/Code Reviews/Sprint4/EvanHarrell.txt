SpriteInfo.cs

Sprite info contains the basic information used with all sprites, positions, velocities, accelerations, height and width, whether it's static, manually
moved, or bounces.  It contains the value for the layer the sprite is in, as well as the frame count, delay, and bounds for animated sprites.  Allowing
each sprite to have it's own info makes it easier to store all the data for those sprites into one location, sprite.Info.  Without this we'd have a cluster
of data in each sprite class, much of which would be copied and identical code to the other classes.  Changing the parameters for one piece of info in one
sprite would require a change in all of them, this way we only need to change one piece of SpriteInfo to spread the change across all the sprites.

I don't see much of a problem with how it is now, however, if the game were more advanced I would suggest seperating some of the information more.
Animation info combined with position info and other sprite info (bounce, bounds, layer, etc.) starts to add up quickly and may make things more difficult
the more there is.
