Specific comments on code quality:

Class is a cleverly written, essential use of the IDrawable interface. It is used by all the sprites we created. 
The dictionary statemap made it really easy to switch the drawn sprite during run time.
It allows us to switch between states too, not just the drawn sprite. 
I thought this was a clever way to go about it and thought he did a great job.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

When we continue adding features to our game, such as levels, or adding methods to certain sprites, this class is pretty robust. This class will support
changes well and most changes will be taken elsewhere in the code. This class has proven to be a staple in the game implementation. I am confident that
it will remain a sturdy, reliable class.
