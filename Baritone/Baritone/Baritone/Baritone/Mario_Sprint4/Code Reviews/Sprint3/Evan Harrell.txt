Specific comments on code quality:

We've had it for a while, but I don't believe it's been looked at since the initial collision was written for it.  This has 3 methods, move, onCollision,
and consume.  Move controls the intial movement from mario, leting it curve down, and eventually consume.  onCollision is the inherited method that decides
what happens when the fireball hits an object, if it's not an enemy, it bounces accordingly, if it is an enemy the object is consumed.  Consume just removes
the object.  It's simple code, but could possibly use some touch up.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

There's currently no limit to the number of fireballs fired at once.  If you spam them, some will float straight away because of collision errors.
There's also a distance limit to where the fireball goes, which should probably need to be lengthened.
