Sprint: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: SpriteMushroom.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Recent changes were Matt Weiss and Evan Harrell.
Specific comments on code quality:

It is set up with most of our like-Sprites. But it has some problems. We haven't started using our state machine so for condition checking
it is missing a few cases. For example, it is currently missing the case to pick up the mushroom as star mario. We've neglected to fix this
while we work on the state machine, so the file poses a few issues.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

When state machine is implemented we will have to refactor quite a bit of the code, along with a few other sprites.
