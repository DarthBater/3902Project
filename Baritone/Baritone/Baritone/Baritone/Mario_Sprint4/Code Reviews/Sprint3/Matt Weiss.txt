Specific comments on code quality:

There are a handful of ways to implement a reset; the way this one was implemented is a bit "raw" in the sense
that it's doing it primarily by brute force. Honestly though, it's simple, and it works. The only concern would
be if it truely is releasing ALL resources from the level and loading fresh ones. Otherwise, too many resets and
we will have a memory build up, perhaps a noticeable one.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

As I already hinted at, there may be a memory issue. I haven't looked into it to confirm this, but whenever you're clearing and re-populating lists like this,
it's always going to be a concern.
