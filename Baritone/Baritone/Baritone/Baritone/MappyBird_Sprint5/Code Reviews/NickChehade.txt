This layer is in charge of dynamically adding pipes and coins as mario progresses throughout the game. Coins are added with chance at random locations. Pipes are added at specific x differences with different gaps between the top and bottom pipe. This is also where the pipes are checked for removal and passing.

It would probably be cleaner to take the code out of Load that is in charge of generating a new pipe and put that into its own method. And the same would go for the coin generation. That way, the Load method would just have to call a method to generate the next pipe and coin based on the given conditions and then add these sprites to the game.
